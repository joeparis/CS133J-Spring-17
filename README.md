    * [Scopes & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/scope%20%26%20closures)
    * [this & Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes)
    * [ES6 & Beyond](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/es6%20%26%20beyond)
* Internet access, required, available in limited fashion in various college computer labs or through your local Internet service provider (ISP).
* Various free software applications and tools will be discussed in class, many of which will be pre-installed on the computers in the Library Computer Lab. 

## Class Policies

You will get the most from this class if you attend every day. Much of the material covered won’t be found in the book. A lot of your learning will involve class discussion which can only happen if you are present. 

Students come from many different backgrounds and have unique life experiences which can enhance class discussions. For this reason, it is crucial for students to share their insights on course-related topics. Current issues involving course- and subject-related matters will be very much a part of the class and I encourage you to come to class ready to share new information and ask questions. Students are expected to be prepared for each class, having completed all reading and homework assignments. The course is extremely cumulative so a good start is essential.

While in class, please set your cell phone to *vibrate*. If you need to take a call, please step out of the room to do so. 

## Assignments

Assignments may include completing designated readings, individual homework problems, lab activities, and individual or group projects.
It is recommended that you use the computers in the labs in McKenzie Hall (MKH-105, MKH-103) or the Library Computer Lab. You are responsible for checking the lab schedule for its hours.

Alternately, you may use your own personal computers provided it has any required software installed.

Assigments are due by 5:00 p.m. on the scheduled due date.

Late assignments will not be accepted, no exceptions.

Assignments may not be submitted via e-mail.

All assignments must be word processed and spell- and grammar-checked.

## Project 

There will be a final project given for the course.

## Assessment

Grades will be determined according to the following schedule:

Type | Weight

No grades of Y, W, WP or Inc will be given in this class. Remember, if you decide not to complete the course is it *your* responsibility to withdraw from it. It is not the instructor's responsibility to drop you. More information about these grades and how they can impact both your financial aid and your overall progress as a student can be found on the [Academic Standards For Financial Aid page](http://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/money-matters/financial-aid/academic-standards-for-financial-aid/academic-standards-for-financial-aid-continued).

## Academic Honesty

Helping, or being helped by, another student during an exam will be considered a breach of academic honesty and is grounds for receiving a zero grade and/or failing the course among other possible remedies as outlined in the [Students' Rights and Responsibilities Handbook](https://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/administration-information/policies/students-rights-responsibilities-and-conduct).

## LBCC Center for Accessibility Resources

The [Center for Accessibility Resources (CFAR)](https://linnbenton.edu/cfar) provides reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments and auxiliary aids to ensure that qualified students with disabilities have access to classes, programs and events at Linn-Benton Community College. Students are responsible for requesting accommodations in a timely manner. To receive appropriate and timely accommodations from LBCC, please give the Center for Accessibility Resources as much advance notice of your disability and specific needs as possible, as certain accommodations such as sign language interpreting take days to weeks to have in place.
