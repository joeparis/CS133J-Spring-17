# CS133J Final Project

The end of the term is approaching and it's time to start thinking about your final project. I'll be giving you broad leeway on deciding what your project will be but it will need to meet the following criteria:

* It must contain a research component. For example, using a JavaScript library such as JQuery, Dojo, Prototype, YUI, etc., or uses AJAX, JSON, Drag and Drop, etc, or using an API such as the Map API from Google, the Twitter API, or the YouTube API.
* It must demonstrate your ability to manipulate the DOM and CSS using JavaScript or a JavaScript library or libraries.
* It must demonstrate your ability to handle events.
* Your JavaScript and CSS should be in external files. Do **not** include any CSS or JavaScript in your html file(s).
* Your project can include more than one html page, but you are not required to do so.

You will be graded on the following:

* Programming Style
* Coding conventions
* Naming conventions
* Comments
* Coding
* Efficient code
* Proper use of functions
* Proper use of control structures
* Proper event handling
* Proper DOM and CSS coding
* Amount of code using researched library or JavaScript technology
* Site Design
* Web Standards
* No deprecated elements or attributes
* HTML and CSS validation
* Pleasant color scheme
* User friendly page layout

Some example final projects are:

* Create a game or other application that implements drag-n-drop using JQuery.
* Similarly, you could make an application or gmae using <code>canvas</code> element to draw objects and animate objects. The application should use JavaScript to manipulate the objects displayed on the <code>canvas</code> element. Your project could, for example, use a physics engine like matter.js in an interesting way.
* Create an application that displays an html editor and adds the generated html to the page on the fly. The user should then be able to hide the editor once the page is generated.
* There's a lot of potential in p5.js.
* Any other application of your choosing that demonstrates the creative use of a JavaScript library or technology.

These applications sound more difficult than they really are due to the incredible number of JavaScript libraries that are available to you. Do the research and play around with the libraries. You will be amazed at what you can do!

We will need to discuss your project idea before you get too far down the path to make sure it is both do-able and meets the criteria above as well as the spirit of the assignment. Your project should be presented and approved no later than May 23.

Due Wednesday, June 14 by 5:00 p.m.
