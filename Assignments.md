# Assignment 1

### Part A

Write the code necessary to declare and initialize one variable of each of the following types:

* A number
* A string with embedded quotes (hint: you will need to use the JavaScript escape character)
* A Boolean
* A homogeneous array using an array literal
* A heterogeneous array using an array literal
* An object using an object literal

Create a simple web page and display your code in it using `<code>` and `<pre>` tags. For this part of the assignment your code should **not** be executable. If you're feeling really adventurous try using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)


### Part B

Write an external JavaScript file that uses `prompt()` to get the user's name and then greets them using `alert()`.

### Part C

Write a JavaScript program that calculates how much it will cost the user to see a movie. Ask them how many adult tickets and how many children's tickets they want. Tickets cost $10.00 and $7.50 respectively. Display the total cost of all tickets to the user.

Post all three parts to the lbccwebdev.net server by 5:00 p.m. on April 13
